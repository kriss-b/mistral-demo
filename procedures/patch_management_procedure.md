# Patch Management Procedure

## 1. Purpose
This procedure ensures the timely and secure application of security patches to all systems in alignment with the **Operations Security Policy**.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all systems, including:
- Servers (physical and virtual).
- Endpoints (laptops, desktops).
- Network devices (routers, firewalls).
- Software applications (third-party and in-house).

## 3. Patch Management Process
### 3.1 Identification
- Monitor vendor security advisories (e.g., Microsoft, Linux, AWS).
- Use automated tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to scan for missing patches.

### 3.2 Prioritization
| **Severity**       | **Definition**                                                                 | **Timeframe**       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Critical           | Exploitable vulnerabilities with severe impact (e.g., remote code execution). | Within 7 days       |
| High               | Vulnerabilities with significant impact (e.g., privilege escalation).         | Within 30 days      |
| Medium/Low         | Vulnerabilities with limited impact.                                          | Within 90 days      |

### 3.3 Testing
- Test patches in a non-production environment before deployment.
- Validate system functionality and performance post-patch.

### 3.4 Deployment
- Deploy patches during maintenance windows to minimize disruption.
- Use automated tools (e.g., Ansible, SCCM) for large-scale deployments.

### 3.5 Verification
- Verify patch installation using automated tools or manual checks.
- Document patch status for audit purposes.

## 4. Emergency Patches
- Critical patches may be deployed outside maintenance windows with approval from the IT Manager.
- Emergency patches shall be documented and reviewed retrospectively.

## 5. Compliance
Non-compliance with this procedure may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts.
