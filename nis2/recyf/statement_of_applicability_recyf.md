# Statement of Applicability — ReCyF (NIS2) Overlay

## 1. Introduction

**ReCyF (Référentiel Cyber France)** is the operational cybersecurity framework published by **ANSSI** to help entities meet their obligations under the **NIS 2 Directive** as transposed into French law. It expresses **20 security objectives**, and for each, *acceptable means of compliance*.

This document is an **overlay on the base ISO 27001 ISMS**, not a parallel system. It maps ReCyF's requirements to the controls already implemented in this ISMS and identifies the **delta** — the requirements ReCyF adds beyond ISO 27001 — so effort focuses only where the base ISMS does not already cover the objective.

- **Source:** ReCyF v2.5 (17/03/2026), © ANSSI, via MesServicesCyber. ReCyF is a **working document** pending the finalisation of the French NIS 2 transposition; requirement text and mappings may still evolve.
- **Coverage ratings** (ISO 27001/27002 vs ReCyF) are taken from ANSSI's own published comparator.

## 2. Entity classification

NIS 2 classifies regulated entities as **Important Entities (EI)** or **Essential Entities (EE)** based on **sector and size thresholds** — a legal determination made *before* any control selection. The applicable ReCyF measures follow directly from that classification.

> **⚠️ Mistral AI's classification is not yet determined. This overlay is provisionally scoped to an Important Entity (EI) so that work can begin, but the classification is `TBD — pending Legal & Compliance confirmation` and must be settled before this overlay is relied upon.**

**Why the determination is open.** Two questions have to be answered, and neither is a matter for the ISMS to decide on its own:

1. **Is the Company in a regulated sector?** NIS 2 Annex I covers *digital infrastructure*, including **cloud computing service providers** and **data centre service providers**. La Plateforme is delivered as a cloud service, and Mistral Compute operates owned GPU and data-centre infrastructure (see [isms_policy.md](../../policies/isms_policy.md) section 7.1). Whether either brings the Company within a listed sector under the French transposition is a legal reading, not a technical one.
2. **Which size threshold does the Company meet?** In Annex I sectors, entities meeting the *medium* enterprise thresholds are Important Entities, while those exceeding the *large* enterprise thresholds are **Essential Entities (EE)** — a materially heavier regime with stronger supervision and higher penalty exposure. Given the Company's headcount and funding trajectory, EE is a realistic outcome and should not be assumed away.

**What changes if the Company is an Essential Entity.** Objectives **16–20** and all EE-only measures come into scope, and this crosswalk becomes incomplete rather than merely provisional. The delta table below would need extending before it could be used as evidence.

Under the provisional EI scoping, **objectives 16–20 and all EE-only measures are out of scope** by classification, not by risk-based exclusion — only the **measures applicable to Important Entities**, within objectives **1–15**, are covered. Treat that boundary as an open assumption, not a settled conclusion.

The Company already maintains contact with ANSSI and CERT-FR ([isms_policy.md](../../policies/isms_policy.md)), which is the natural channel for confirming this classification.

## 3. How to read this overlay

Each in-scope measure is rated by how well the base ISO 27001 ISMS already covers it:

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **High** | Base ISMS already satisfies the intent | Cross-reference only — no new work |
| 🟠 **Medium** | Theme covered, but ReCyF pins a specific frequency / ANSSI-conformity / scope | Usually a one-line addition to an existing base document |
| 🔴 **Low** | ISO 27001 does not cover it | Genuine gap — new content required |

The **Description** column reproduces ANSSI's verbatim acceptable-means-of-compliance text (© ANSSI); the **Requirement** column is the measure's theme.

The **Implementation status** column uses the values defined in the [ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability](../../statement_of_applicability.md).

**Base ISMS changes are deferred.** Where a measure requires a change to a base ISO 27001 document, that change is **not made here**; it is captured by the corresponding **ReCyF check** (`nis2/recyf/checks/`), which verifies the base ISMS and fails until the gap is closed.

The table below lists the **delta measures** (🔴 Low + 🟠 Medium). The remaining EI measures are rated 🟢 High: they are already satisfied by the base ISMS and, by design, are not restated here (see the high-coverage measures section).

## 5. High-coverage measures (🟢) — covered by the base ISMS

The remaining in-scope measures across objectives 1–15 are rated 🟢 High coverage by ANSSI's comparator: the base ISO 27001 ISMS already satisfies them through its existing Annex A controls, policies, and checks. Consistent with this overlay's sole purpose — capturing the delta ReCyF adds *beyond* ISO 27001 — these measures are **deliberately not restated here**; doing so would duplicate the base ISMS and break its single-source-of-truth principle. Their compliance is evidenced by the corresponding base ISO 27001 controls, not by this overlay.
