# Information Security Management System (ISMS) Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the overarching policy governing the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of **ACME CORP**. It serves as the master policy for information security, providing the framework within which all other information security policies, procedures, and controls operate.

This policy is aligned with **ISO 27001:2022 (Clauses 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10)** and supports the Company's commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

---

## 2. Introduction & Objectives

ACME CORP is committed to establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving its ISMS in accordance with ISO 27001:2022.

The following are the information security objectives for the current annual period. They are reviewed and updated at each management review (see Section 10).

- Maintain zero critical or high security incidents.
- Maintain ISO 27001:2022 certification with no critical non-conformities.
- Achieve 100% completion of security awareness training across all employees by year-end.
- Zero orphaned accounts found during access reviews.
- Maintain 99.9% availability of the SaaS service.

---

## 3. Context of the Organisation

ACME CORP operates a SaaS platform. The Company processes sensitive customer data and relies on cloud infrastructure for the delivery of its services.

The ISMS has been designed to reflect the Company's size, risk profile, and operational context, balancing security requirements with business agility.

## 4. Internal & External Issues

The following issues are considered in defining the scope and objectives of the ISMS.

### 4.1 Internal Issues

| Issue | Impact on ISMS |
|-------|----------------|
| Small team size | Limited dedicated security resources; roles shall be combined |
| Remote and hybrid working model | Increased endpoint and access control requirements |
| Reliance on cloud infrastructure | Shared responsibility model with cloud providers shall be managed |
| Rapid product development pace | Security shall be integrated into development processes (DevSecOps) |
| Early-stage security maturity | Policies and controls are being progressively implemented |

### 4.2 External Issues

| Issue | Impact on ISMS |
|-------|----------------|
| GDPR and data protection regulations | Strict requirements on personal data handling and breach notification |
| Customer contractual requirements | Some customers require evidence of ISO 27001 compliance |
| Evolving threat landscape | Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence required |
| Third-party and supply chain risks | Vendors and cloud providers shall meet security standards |
| Climate change (ISO/IEC 27001:2022/AMD 1:2024) | The organization shall determine whether climate change is a relevant issue affecting its context. Where relevant, climate-related risks (e.g. extreme weather disrupting facilities or supply chains) shall be assessed and treated within the risk management process. |
| Regulatory requirements in target markets | Compliance obligations vary across jurisdictions |

---

## 5. Interested Parties

The following interested parties have been identified as having requirements relevant to information security.

| Interested Party | Key Requirements |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Customers | Confidentiality and integrity of their data; evidence of security compliance |
| Employees | Clear security policies; safe and secure working environment |
| Regulators (e.g., CNIL, ICO) | Compliance with GDPR and applicable data protection laws |
| Law enforcement authorities | Cooperation in the event of a security incident or criminal investigation |
| Special interest groups (e.g., CERTs, ISACs, security communities) | Threat intelligence sharing; awareness of emerging vulnerabilities and best practices |
| Cloud and technology vendors | Clear contractual security obligations; timely incident notification |
| Investors and board | Adequate risk management; business continuity assurance |
| Certification body | Compliance with ISO 27001:2022 requirements |

### 5.1 Contact with Authorities
The ISMS Owner and CISO are responsible for maintaining appropriate contacts with relevant authorities, including data protection supervisory authorities (e.g., CNIL, ICO), law enforcement, and national cybersecurity agencies. These contacts shall be activated in the event of a significant security incident, data breach, or when required by applicable law. Contact details are maintained by the Legal & Compliance function and reviewed annually.

### 5.2 Contact with Special Interest Groups
The CISO is responsible for maintaining membership of, or engagement with, relevant security special interest groups, such as national CERTs, sector-specific ISACs, and professional security communities. This ensures the Company remains informed of emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and security best practices. Threat intelligence gathered through these channels feeds into the risk assessment process.

---

## 6. Dependencies & Interfaces

The ISMS does not operate in isolation. It interfaces with the following internal functions and external systems:

- **Legal & Compliance**: Regulatory monitoring, contract review, NDA management.
- **Human Resources**: Onboarding, offboarding, training, and disciplinary processes.
- **Engineering & IT**: Implementation of technical controls, patch management, and secure development.
- **Finance & Procurement**: Vendor assessment and contractual security requirements.
- **Executive Leadership**: Resource allocation, risk acceptance, and strategic alignment.
- **Cloud Providers**: Shared responsibility model, security configurations, and incident coordination.

---

## 7. Scope of the ISMS

### 7.1 In Scope

**Systems**
- SaaS platform.
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Internal tools (e.g., CI/CD, monitoring, code repositories).
- Customer data and user accounts.
- Office network infrastructure and on-premises equipment.

**People**
- 5 engineers (development, operations, security).
- All employees of the Company.
- Third-party vendors with access to systems (e.g., payment processors, hosting providers).

**Locations**
- Main office (primary place of business).
- Remote workstations (employees working from home or other locations).
- Cloud data centers (hosting providers).

### 7.2 Out of Scope
- Physical security of employee home offices.
- Personal devices not used for work.

### 7.3 Justification
The ISMS covers all digital assets and processes critical to the SaaS platform, as well as the physical security of the main office. Remote working locations are included in scope for logical and endpoint security controls, but physical security of individual home offices is outside the Company's direct control and is therefore excluded.

---

## 8. Locations

The ISMS applies to the following locations:

| Location | Type | In Scope |
|----------|------|----------|
| Main office | Primary place of business | Full scope (physical and logical) |
| Remote working locations | Employee home offices and other remote sites | Logical and endpoint security controls only |
| Cloud data centres | Hosted by third-party providers | Logical controls and shared responsibility |

---

## 9. Governance

| Role | Accountability | Name |
|------|---------------|------|
| **ISMS Owner** | Overall accountability for the ISMS | _TBD_ |
| **CISO** | Technical and operational implementation | _TBD_ |
| **CEO** | Executive oversight; approves the ISMS Policy | _TBD_ |
| **All employees and contractors** | Comply with information security policies and report security events | — |

Full role definitions are documented in the **[Roles and Responsibilities Policy](roles_and_responsibilities_policy.md)**.

---

## 10. Executive Management Review

The executive team conducts a formal **management review of the ISMS** at least once per year. The review covers:
