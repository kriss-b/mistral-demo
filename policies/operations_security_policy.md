# Operations Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy ensures the secure operation of information systems and processes in alignment with **ISO 27001:2022 (Controls A.8.7, A.8.8, A.8.13, A.8.15, A.8.16, A.8.17 and A.8.19)**, which cover protection against malware, vulnerability management, backups, logging, monitoring, clock synchronisation, and software installation.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Company’s information systems.

## 3. Policy Statements
### 3.1 Change Management
- All changes to information systems shall be documented, tested, and approved before implementation.
