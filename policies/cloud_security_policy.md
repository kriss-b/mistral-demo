# Cloud Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines the information security requirements for the use of cloud services, in alignment with **ISO 27001:2022 (Control A.5.23 — Information security for use of cloud services)**. It ensures that cloud services are adopted, configured, and operated in a manner that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Company and customer information.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all cloud services, including infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and software (SaaS) services, regardless of whether they are used for production, development, or internal operations. It applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who provision, configure, or use cloud services on behalf of the Company.

---

## 3. Cloud Provider Assessment and Approval

- All cloud services shall be formally assessed and approved before use. Unapproved cloud services shall not be used to process or store Company or customer data.
- Cloud providers shall be assessed against the criteria defined in the **[Supplier Security Policy](supplier_security_policy.md)** and the **[Vendor Security Review Template](../procedures/vendor_security_review_template.md)**.
- Approved cloud providers are maintained in the asset register (see **[Asset Management Policy](asset_management_policy.md)**).
- Cloud service agreements shall include provisions for security, data protection, incident notification, audit rights, and data deletion upon termination.

---

## 4. Shared Responsibility Model

- The CTO is responsible for maintaining a documented understanding of the shared responsibility model for each cloud provider in use, defining which security controls are the provider's responsibility and which are the Company's.
- Company-owned responsibilities (e.g., identity and access management, data encryption, application security, logging) shall be explicitly assigned and implemented.
- Provider security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2) shall be reviewed annually to confirm continued compliance.

---

## 5. Data Classification and Residency

- Data stored or processed in cloud environments shall be classified in accordance with the **[Data Classification Policy](data_classification_policy.md)**.
- Confidential and Restricted data shall only be stored in cloud regions that meet the Company's data residency requirements, including GDPR obligations for EU personal data.
- Data residency requirements shall be verified before onboarding a new cloud provider or enabling a new cloud region.

---

## 6. Access Control for Cloud Environments

- Access to cloud management consoles and APIs shall follow the least privilege principle, in accordance with the **[Access Control Policy](access_control_policy.md)**.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all cloud console and administrative access.
- Root or super-admin accounts shall not be used for day-to-day operations and shall be secured with strong credentials and MFA.
- Access rights to cloud environments shall be reviewed semi-annually and revoked promptly when no longer required.
- All access keys and API credentials shall be rotated regularly and shall never be hardcoded in source code or configuration files.

---

## 7. Security Configuration and Hardening

- All cloud resources shall be deployed in accordance with security hardening guidelines (e.g., CIS Benchmarks for the relevant cloud provider).
- Default credentials and unnecessary services shall be disabled before deployment.
- Network security controls (firewalls, security groups, private subnets) shall be configured to restrict access to the minimum required.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates shall be reviewed for security misconfigurations before deployment, in accordance with the **[Secure Development Policy](secure_development_policy.md)**.
- Configuration management shall ensure that cloud environments remain in their approved secure state (see **[Statement of Applicability](../statement_of_applicability.md)**, A.8.9).

---

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

- Cloud activity logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor) shall be enabled for all production environments and retained for at least 90 days.
- Alerts shall be configured for high-risk events, including unauthorised access attempts, changes to security configurations, and unusual data access patterns.
- Logs shall be protected from tampering and shall not be accessible to the accounts they monitor.
- Monitoring requirements are defined in the **[Operations Security Policy](operations_security_policy.md)**.

---

## 9. Incident Management with Cloud Providers

- In the event of a security incident involving a cloud service, the CISO shall engage the cloud provider's security or incident response team as appropriate.
- Cloud provider incident notification clauses shall be reviewed during onboarding to ensure timely alerting obligations are defined.
- Cloud-related incidents are managed in accordance with the **[Incident Management Policy](incident_management_policy.md)** and **[Incident Response Plan](../incidents/incident_response_plan.md)**.

---

## 10. Exit Strategy and Portability

- Before onboarding a cloud provider, the CTO shall document an exit strategy covering data export, migration, and deletion procedures.
- Cloud service agreements shall include provisions for data portability and secure deletion of Company data upon contract termination.
- Data deletion by the provider shall be confirmed in writing upon termination of the service.

---

## 11. Compliance
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts.
