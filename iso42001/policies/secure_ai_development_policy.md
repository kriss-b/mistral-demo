# Secure AI Development Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for integrating responsible AI principles and data governance throughout the AI system lifecycle. It ensures that safety, fairness, and transparency are addressed by design, not as an afterthought, in alignment with **ISO 42001:2023 (Controls A.6 — AI System Lifecycle and A.7 — Data for AI Systems)**.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third parties involved in the design, development, testing, deployment, or operation of AI systems.
- All AI systems developed or operated internally, including:
  - AI models trained or fine-tuned on Company data.
  - Third-party AI services integrated into Company products or operations.
  - AI-assisted tools used to process Company or customer data.

---

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Responsible AI by Design
- Responsible AI requirements (fairness, transparency, human oversight, safety) shall be defined and documented during the design phase of any AI system.
- An **AI System Impact Assessment** shall be conducted before deployment, in accordance with the **[AI System Impact Assessment Template](../procedures/ai_system_impact_assessment_template.md)**.
- Privacy-by-design principles shall be applied to all AI systems handling personal data.

### 3.2 Data Acquisition and Quality
- Data used to train, fine-tune, or evaluate AI systems shall be acquired lawfully and ethically.
- Training and evaluation datasets shall be assessed for quality, representativeness, and potential bias before use.
- Data provenance shall be documented: origin, collection method, and any transformations applied.

### 3.3 Data Preparation and Bias Management
- Data preparation steps (cleaning, labelling, augmentation, sampling) shall be documented and reproducible.
- Datasets shall be evaluated for bias that could lead to discriminatory or unfair model outputs.
- Test datasets shall be kept separate from training data and shall not be used during training or fine-tuning.

### 3.4 Data Classification and Protection
- All data used in AI systems shall be classified in accordance with the **[Data Classification Policy](../../policies/data_classification_policy.md)**.
- Restricted and Confidential data shall not be used in training without explicit approval from the CTO and CISO.
- Personal data used in AI systems shall comply with applicable data protection regulations, including GDPR and the EU AI Act.

### 3.5 Model Evaluation and Testing
- AI models shall be evaluated against defined performance, fairness, and safety metrics before deployment.
- Adversarial testing (e.g., prompt injection, edge cases, out-of-distribution inputs) shall be conducted before release.
- Evaluation results shall be documented and reviewed by the CTO prior to deployment approval.

### 3.6 Deployment and Change Management
- All AI system deployments and significant changes (model updates, fine-tuning, prompt changes, provider upgrades) shall go through the change management process.
- Production AI systems shall be separated from development and test environments.
- Deployment shall not proceed if critical evaluation findings remain unresolved.

### 3.7 AI System Documentation
- Each AI system shall have documented intended use, known limitations, performance metrics, and data provenance before deployment.
- Documentation shall be kept up to date across the full lifecycle and made available to users, auditors, and the incident response team.
- Significant changes to an AI system shall trigger a documentation update prior to redeployment.

### 3.8 Monitoring and Incident Management
- AI systems in production shall operate within the parameters and constraints defined during the impact assessment and documented at deployment; inputs or use cases outside these parameters shall be rejected or escalated to the system owner.
- AI systems shall be monitored for performance degradation, output drift, and unexpected behaviour.
- AI-specific incidents (e.g., hallucination, biased output, prompt injection) shall be reported and handled in accordance with the **[Incident Response Plan](../../incidents/incident_response_plan.md)**.
- Monitoring findings shall be reviewed quarterly and feed into the next model evaluation cycle.

### 3.9 Decommissioning
- AI systems shall be decommissioned securely when no longer in use.
- Model weights, training data, and associated logs shall be disposed of in accordance with the **[Data Retention and Disposal Policy](../../policies/data_retention_disposal_policy.md)**.
- Decommissioning shall be documented and approved by the CTO.

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
### 4.1 CTO (Owner)
- Oversee the implementation and enforcement of this policy.
- Approve AI system deployments and decommissioning decisions.

### 4.2 AI/ML Developers
- Follow responsible AI development standards and participate in AI safety training.
- Document data provenance, model evaluation results, and known limitations.

### 4.3 IT Team
- Maintain separation of AI development, test, and production environments.
- Support monitoring infrastructure for deployed AI systems.

### 4.4 CISO
- Define security requirements for AI systems, including adversarial testing standards.
- Ensure AI-specific risks are captured in the risk register with appropriate AI Specificity classification.

---

## 5. Compliance
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts.

---

## 6. Review and Updates
This policy will be reviewed **annually** or after significant changes to AI systems, development practices, or applicable regulations (e.g., EU AI Act).
