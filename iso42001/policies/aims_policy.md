# AI Management System (AIMS) Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the overarching policy governing the AI Management System (AIMS) of **ACME CORP**. It serves as the master policy for responsible AI, providing the framework within which all other AI-related policies, procedures, and controls operate.

This policy is aligned with **ISO 42001:2023 (Clauses 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10)** and supports the Company's commitment to developing, deploying, and using AI systems in a responsible, transparent, and accountable manner.

---

## 2. Introduction & Objectives

ACME CORP is committed to establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving its AIMS in accordance with ISO 42001:2023.

The objectives of the AIMS are to:

- Ensure AI systems are developed and operated responsibly, with fairness, transparency, and human oversight.
- Identify, assess, and treat AI-related risks and impacts in a systematic and proportionate manner.
- Ensure compliance with applicable AI regulations, including the EU AI Act and ISO 42001:2023.
- Build trust with customers, partners, and regulators through demonstrable AI governance practices.
- Foster a culture of AI safety and ethical awareness across the organisation.
- Protect individuals and society from potential harms arising from AI systems.

These objectives are reviewed at least annually as part of the management review process (see Section 10).

---

## 3. Context of the Organisation

ACME CORP develops and operates AI-powered products and services, including systems that interact with customers and process sensitive data. The Company uses and integrates third-party foundation models and AI services as part of its product offerings.

The AIMS has been designed to reflect the Company's size, AI maturity, and operational context, balancing AI governance requirements with business agility.

## 12. Description of Activities

### 12.1 AI Risk Assessment
Risks specific to AI systems are identified, assessed, and treated in accordance with the **[Risk Assessment Framework](../../risks/risk_assessment_framework.md)** and **[Risk Assessment Procedure](../../risks/risk_assessment_procedure.md)**. Results are documented in the **[Risk Register](../../risks/risks_register.md)**, with AI Specificity classified as `Indirect` or `Direct`.

### 12.2 AI System Impact Assessment
Before any AI system is deployed, an impact assessment shall be completed in accordance with the **[AI System Impact Assessment Template](../procedures/ai_system_impact_assessment_template.md)**. The assessment evaluates potential harms to individuals, groups, and society, and defines mitigation measures and human oversight requirements.

### 12.3 Policy and Documented Information Management
All AIMS policies and documented information are reviewed at least annually. Policy owners are responsible for initiating reviews and obtaining approval from the CTO. Documented information shall remain accurate, accessible, and fit for purpose. Version history is maintained in the Changelog of each document.

### 12.4 AI Safety Training
All employees complete AI safety training as part of the annual security awareness programme, as defined in the **[Employee Training Procedure](../../procedures/employee_training_procedure.md)**. Employees developing or operating AI systems receive additional role-specific AI governance training.

### 12.5 AI Incident Management
AI-specific incidents are managed in accordance with the **[Incident Response Plan](../../incidents/incident_response_plan.md)**. AI incidents include hallucination, biased output, prompt injection, model failure, and harmful AI-generated content.

### 12.6 Supplier AI Management
Third-party AI providers and suppliers using AI to process Company data are assessed in accordance with the **[Supplier Security Policy](../../policies/supplier_security_policy.md)** and the **[Vendor Security Review Template](../../procedures/vendor_security_review_template.md)**.

### 12.7 Nonconformity and Corrective Actions
Nonconformities identified from any source (audits, incidents, management reviews, or employee feedback) shall be recorded, root-caused, and resolved by the responsible owner. Corrective actions are tracked to resolution by the CTO and reported at the next management review.

### 12.8 Performance Monitoring and Measurement
The CTO monitors and measures AI management performance on an ongoing basis. Key inputs include AI system monitoring results, incident metrics, impact assessment outcomes, training completion rates, and audit findings. Results are consolidated and presented at the annual management review.

### 12.9 Continual Improvement
Improvement opportunities are identified from all AIMS activities, including audits, incidents, risk assessments, management reviews, and performance monitoring. The CTO maintains a log of improvement opportunities, prioritises them based on risk and impact, and tracks their implementation.
