# AI Management System (AIMS) Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the overarching policy governing the AI Management System (AIMS) of **Mistral AI**. It serves as the master policy for responsible AI, providing the framework within which all other AI-related policies, procedures, and controls operate.

This policy is aligned with **ISO 42001:2023 (Clauses 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10)** and supports the Company's commitment to developing, deploying, and using AI systems in a responsible, transparent, and accountable manner.

---

## 2. Introduction & Objectives

Mistral AI is committed to establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving its AIMS in accordance with ISO 42001:2023.

The following are the AI management objectives for the current annual period. They take into account the results of the AI risk assessment and AI system impact assessments, and are reviewed and updated at each management review (see Section 10).

- 100% of AI systems in the [AI Systems Register](../../run/registers/ai_systems_register.md) have a completed impact assessment before deployment.
- Zero AI systems in production with a harm rated High in its impact assessment and no documented mitigation.
- Zero AI systems classified as high risk operating without documented human oversight measures.
- 100% of AI systems in the register reviewed within the annual review cycle.
- 100% of general-purpose AI models released — open-weight or commercial — have completed and documented safety evaluations before release.
- 100% of released GPAI models have technical documentation sufficient to meet the Company's obligations as a GPAI provider under the EU AI Act.
- 100% completion of AI safety training across all employees using AI tools by year-end.
- 100% of AI suppliers assessed against AI governance requirements before onboarding.

## 3. Context of the Organisation

Mistral AI is a frontier AI lab that researches, trains, and releases its own open-weight and commercial large language models (the Mistral and Mixtral families and their successors) as its core business. It delivers these models directly to customers and developers through **Le Chat** and **La Plateforme**, and distributes them as open weights and via cloud marketplaces. As a developer and **provider of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models**, the Company carries primary responsibility for the responsible development, evaluation, documentation, and safe release of the models it builds. It also integrates a limited set of third-party models (e.g., image generation in Le Chat), for which it acts as a deployer.

The AIMS has been designed to reflect the Company's position as a foundation-model developer operating at frontier scale, its rapid growth, and its exposure under the EU AI Act's provisions for GPAI models, balancing rigorous AI governance with the pace of AI research.

## 4. Internal & External Issues

The following issues are considered in defining the scope and objectives of the AIMS.

### 4.1 Internal Issues

| Issue | Impact on AIMS |
|-------|----------------|
| The Company develops and releases its own frontier models | Primary responsibility for training-data governance, evaluation, safety, and responsible release rests internally |
| Model weights and training pipelines are crown-jewel assets | AI governance is tightly coupled with information security controls around these assets |
| Rapid AI research and release cadence | Models, capabilities, and risks change faster than traditional software; governance must keep pace |
| Open-weight release model | Once released, weights cannot be recalled; pre-release capability and misuse assessment is critical |
| Scaling AI-governance and safety functions during rapid growth | AI-safety, evaluation, and governance capacity must scale with model capability |
| AI systems span multiple products and modalities (text, code, audio, vision) | Broad and evolving scope of AI systems requiring consistent governance |

### 4.2 External Issues

| Issue | Impact on AIMS |
|-------|----------------|
| EU AI Act obligations for providers of GPAI models (incl. systemic-risk tier) | Documentation, transparency, evaluation, systemic-risk assessment, and serious-incident reporting duties |
| Customer and regulator concerns about AI transparency, bias, and safety | Evidence of responsible-AI practices increasingly required in enterprise and public-sector deals |
| Evolving AI threat landscape | New attack vectors (prompt injection, jailbreaks, model extraction, data poisoning) require ongoing attention |
| Public and societal scrutiny of frontier models and open-weight releases | Reputational and policy risk from harmful, biased, or misused AI outputs |
| Dual-use and misuse concerns for capable models | Release decisions must weigh potential for misuse (cyber, bio, disinformation) |
| Third-party and supply-chain risks (compute, data, integrated models) | Compute/data-centre partners, data suppliers, and integrated model providers shall meet governance standards |
